Subfunctor annotation experiment 2025 data

There were two tasks, named "s7" and "loc".

There were four annotators, labelled A, B, C, and D.

The interpretation of columns depends on the task:

 | Column | Task "s7"                | Task "loc"                      |
 |--------+--------------------------+---------------------------------|
 |      1 | Identifier               | Identifier                      |
 |      2 | Sentence                 | Sentence                        |
 |      3 | Functor, choice 1        | Subfunctor, choice 1            |
 |      4 | Subfunctor for functor 1 | Special lablel for subfunctor 1 |
 |      5 | Functor, choice 2        | Subfunctor, choice 2            |
 |      6 | Subfunctor for functor 2 | Special lablel for subfunctor 2 |

To create the golden data, a fifth annotator was used (G). They only
annotated the sentences with ties.
